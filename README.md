# Copy Paste Notes

## What is it?

I spend most of my time on the keyboard and try to avoid the mouse as much as possible.

Instead of putting notes in Google Keep / Apple Notes / a text file where I have find the note I want, Copy Past Notes is a CLI that allows you to save a note under a key (using either an in-memory database or SQLite), list out the notes you've saved, get a specific note and copy a note to the clipboard.

For example, to copy a note to your clipboard you run `cpn copy my-important-note`, which will make the note ready for you to paste somewhere.
